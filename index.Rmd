# Application for Calculating Relationships of Transmission and MPG

Date: 2014/12/21

--- .class #id 

## The purpose of this application

Many peaple are interested in
exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per
gallon (MPG).
They are particularly interested in the following two questions:
* "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

This application can calculate coefficients of multiple model
fittings.

## The characteristics of this application

You can select variables as predectors for mph interactively.

## Examples

```{r echo=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
am <- mtcars$am
am[am == 0] <- ":automatic"
am[am == 1] <- ":manual"
mtcars$am <- factor(am)
```

* If you choose only am a predector, you can get a result below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
indexes <- c(9)
mtcars2 <- mtcars[,c(indexes,1)]
fit  <- lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars2)
summary(fit)$coefficients
```

* If you choose am and cyl as predectors, you can get a result below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
indexes <- c(9, 2)
mtcars2 <- mtcars[,c(indexes,1)]
fit  <- lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars2)
summary(fit)$coefficients
```
